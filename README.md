# timedPencil
A pencil that changes its colour with time. Easily know the order of writing/drawing.

Have you ever been in a situation when a friend sent you a solution for a hard and long mathematical task, but you had no idea in what order the solving steps were written?
TimedPencil was designed to prevent such situations from happening (not to prevent friends sending you solutions, but to prevent verwirrtnes).
The colour of the pencil changes with time, with every step written.
Instantly know how the task was solved from start to end.
